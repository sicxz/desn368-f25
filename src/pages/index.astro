                <h2>Welcome to the Real Thing</h2>
                <p>Most people live on the surface of the web—scrolling, clicking, tapping. But beneath all of that, there's structure. Logic. Craft.</p>
                
                <p>In this class, you'll learn to read and write the source code that powers the modern internet. Not with drag-and-drop tools. Not through shortcuts. But with the foundational tools—HTML and CSS—the way it actually works.</p>

                <p><strong>This isn't a bootcamp. This isn't a YouTube tutorial. This is the real thing.</strong></p>
